⚠️ This button **cannot one-click deploy** this project: it relies on a D1 database and Secrets, which require manually creating the DB, running migrations, and setting secrets — the button fails at framework detection. Please follow the 📖 [Deployment Guide](./docs/GUIDE.md) instead (~5 min).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended for personal use to manage your own email accounts. Ensure you have legal authorization for all accounts you manage. The default Client ID is Mozilla Thunderbird's public ID for quick setup only — registering your own Azure app is recommended for production use. The author assumes no liability for any misuse.

## 🙏 Credits

This project is a rewrite of [xiaozhi349/outlookEmail](https://github.com/xiaozhi349/outlookEmail), originally built with Python Flask + SQLite. It has been migrated to Cloudflare Workers + D1 with a completely new frontend and backend. Thanks to the original author.
